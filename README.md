## ✨ What is CodeCognition?

CodeCognition leverages Claude Code's 2025 cutting-edge features (subagents, hooks, parallel processing) to create the first **true multi-agent development framework**. Instead of a single AI assistant, you get a coordinated team of 8 specialists working together.

### 🎯 Key Innovations

- **8 Independent Agents** - Each with 200K context (1.6M total effective context)
- **Parallel Processing** - Up to 10 agents working simultaneously  
- **Intelligent Coordination** - Agents communicate and hand off tasks automatically
- **Persistent Memory** - Knowledge accumulates across sessions and projects
- **Smart Automation** - Event-driven hooks for seamless workflow integration
- **Quality Gates** - Built-in validation and security checkpoints

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: NPM/NPX (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g codecognition-framework

# Or use npx (no installation required)
npx codecognition-framework install
```

### Option 2: Direct GitHub Install

```bash
# Quick install script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multimedium-dev/codecognition-framework/main/install.sh | bash

# Or manual clone
git clone https://github.com/multimedium-dev/codecognition-framework.git
cd codecognition-framework
./install.sh
```

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code 1.0.60+** (subagents support required)
- **Node.js 14+** (for installation scripts)
- **Python 3.8+** (for hook automation)

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install the framework
codecognition install

# 2. Verify installation  
codecognition status

# 3. Start Claude Code
claude

# 4. Test multi-agent coordination
```

**In Claude Code:**
```
You: Analyze this codebase architecture using multiple agents
You: Implement user authentication with full quality gates  
You: @architect review the system design
You: Launch emergency response for the database performance issue
```

## 🤖 Meet Your AI Team

| Agent | Specialization | Key Capabilities |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **🏗️ Architect** | System Design | Architecture analysis, design patterns, technology decisions |
| **⚙️ Implementation Engineer** | Code Development | Feature implementation, refactoring, bug fixes |
| **🛡️ Quality Guardian** | Security & Testing | Security analysis, testing strategies, code review |
| **🚀 DevOps Orchestrator** | Infrastructure | Deployment, monitoring, performance optimization |
| **📚 Documentation Specialist** | Technical Writing | API docs, user guides, knowledge management |
| **🔬 Research Analyst** | Technology Research | Dependency analysis, technology evaluation |  
| **🔧 Problem Solver** | Debugging | Root cause analysis, troubleshooting, incident response |
| **🎯 Integration Manager** | Coordination | Workflow orchestration, agent coordination |

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Multi-Agent Feature Development
```
"Implement a user dashboard feature with full quality gates"
```
*Automatically engages: Architect → Implementation Engineer → Quality Guardian → Documentation Specialist*

### Emergency Response
```  
"Debug the critical API timeout errors affecting production"
```
*Coordinates: Problem Solver → DevOps Orchestrator → Quality Guardian → Integration Manager*

### Comprehensive Analysis
```
"Launch 10 parallel agents to analyze this entire codebase"
```
*Distributes analysis across all agents working simultaneously*

### Specific Agent Invocation
```
"@quality-guardian perform security audit of authentication system"
"@architect evaluate the microservices architecture"
"@problem-solver investigate the memory leak in user sessions"
```

## 🎛️ Management Commands

```bash
codecognition install          # Install the framework
codecognition status           # Check installation and configuration
codecognition agents           # List all agents and their status
codecognition docs             # Open documentation
codecognition clean            # Clean up old logs and temporary files
codecognition uninstall        # Remove the framework
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The framework automatically configures Claude Code with optimal settings:

- **Permission Skipping**: Enabled by default for seamless operation
- **Agent Coordination**: Intelligent task distribution and communication
- **Persistent Memory**: Knowledge retention across sessions
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation checkpoints
- **Smart Hooks**: Event-driven workflow automation

Customize via `~/.claude/settings.json` or project-specific `.claude/settings.json`.
