## üîÑ Communication Patterns

### Message Types

| Type | Purpose | Priority | Response Required |
|------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| `context_share` | Share findings between agents | Medium | Optional |
| `coordination_request` | Request help from specific agent | High | Required |
| `decision_broadcast` | Announce critical decisions | High | Acknowledge |
| `status_update` | Report task completion | Low | None |
| `emergency_alert` | Critical issues requiring immediate attention | Critical | Required |

### Communication Flow

1. **Agent Initialization**: Each agent announces capabilities and availability
2. **Context Sharing**: Agents share relevant findings and insights
3. **Coordination Requests**: Agents request specific help from specialists
4. **Decision Broadcasting**: Major decisions are shared with relevant agents
5. **Status Updates**: Progress reports maintain workflow visibility

## üß† Memory Management

### Memory Types

#### Shared Knowledge Base
- Cross-agent insights and patterns
- Best practices learned through experience
- Common solutions to recurring problems
- Technology preferences and decisions

#### Agent-Specific Memory
- Specialized knowledge unique to each agent
- Learning history and capability evolution
- Success patterns for agent's domain
- Domain-specific lessons learned

#### Project Context
- Project-specific insights and constraints
- Team preferences and coding standards
- Historical decisions and outcomes
- Stakeholder requirements and feedback

#### Pattern Library
- Proven workflow templates
- Code patterns and implementations
- Problem-solution mappings
- Integration and collaboration patterns

### Memory Operations

#### Writing Memory
```json
{
  "memory_type": "shared_knowledge",
  "category": "performance_optimization",
  "key": "database_query_patterns",
  "content": {
    "pattern": "Use connection pooling with read replicas",
    "context": "E-commerce application with high read traffic",
    "results": "40% query time improvement, 60% throughput increase",
    "conditions": "PostgreSQL, >1000 concurrent users"
  },
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "source_agent": "problem-solver",
  "validation": "tested in production"
}
```

#### Memory Retrieval
- Automatic context loading based on task similarity
- Pattern matching for similar problems and solutions
- Historical success/failure analysis for decision making
- Cross-project knowledge application

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Orchestration

### Parallel Execution Patterns

#### Maximum Parallelism (10 agents)
```
Launch 10 parallel agents to explore different aspects:
- 3 agents for codebase analysis
- 2 agents for security assessment  
- 2 agents for performance evaluation
- 2 agents for integration analysis
- 1 agent for coordination
```

#### Sequential Refinement
```
Phase 1: Architect analyzes system design
Phase 2: Implementation Engineer codes solution
Phase 3: Quality Guardian validates implementation
Phase 4: DevOps Orchestrator prepares deployment
```

#### Hybrid Coordination
```
Parallel Discovery ‚Üí Sequential Refinement ‚Üí Parallel Validation
```

### Quality Gates

#### Automated Quality Gates
- Code quality metrics validation
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance threshold validation
- Documentation completeness checks
- Test coverage requirements

#### Agent-Driven Quality Gates
- Architectural consistency review (Architect)
- Implementation quality assessment (Quality Guardian)
- Operational readiness validation (DevOps Orchestrator)
- Documentation quality review (Documentation Specialist)

## üîó Integration Patterns
